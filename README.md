# FCND - 3D Motion Planning


This project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where you executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project you will integrate the techniques that you have learned throughout the last several lessons to plan a path through an urban environment. Check out the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) for more detail on what constitutes a passing submission.

## Step 1: Download the Simulator
In this beta version a link to the simulator is provided for you, but for students, this step will read: 

"If you haven't already, download the version of the simulator that's appropriate for your operating system [from this repository]()" (link to be added).

## Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
If you haven't already, set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda following instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

## Step 3: Clone this Repository (repository is currently private, but students will have access)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning
```
## Step 4: Test setup
Your starting point here will be the [solution code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer/blob/solution/backyard_flyer.py) for the Backyard Flyer project. Before you start modifying the code, make sure that your Backyard Flyer solution code works as expected and your drone can perform the square flight pathin the new simulator. To do this, start the simulator and run the [`backyard_flyer.py`](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer/blob/solution/backyard_flyer.py) script.

```py
source activate fcnd # if you haven't already sourced your Python environment, do so now.
python backyard_flyer.py
```
The quad should take off, fly a square pattern and land, just as in the previous project. If everything works then you are ready to start work on this project. 

## Step 5: Inspect the relevant files
For this project, you will adding code to your `backyard_flyer.py` script and if you like, creating another script, where you'll implement your planning solution. Here you'll also find a file called `colliders.csv`, which contains the 2.5D map of the simulator environment. As a side note, `colliders.csv` is actually an output from the simulator and you can generate a new copy by pressing <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> when running the simulator. 


## Step 6: Modifications to `backyard_flyer.py`

- Within the `States()` class, define a new state called `PLANNING`, which you'll initialize before taking off in order to wait for your flight computer to find the path between the start and goal locations. 

- Within your `local_position_callback()` function, you can remove the line that generates waypoints using the `self.calculate_box()` function.  Instead, you'll define waypoints using your path planning algorithm.

- Within your `state_callback()` function you'll need to add some new functionality as well. In this case, if `States.ARMING` you'll want to transition into path planning, for example, by calling your `plan_path()` function as described below. Within your `plan_path()` function you can set your state to `PLANNING`.  Then within your state callback if `States.PLANNING` you have successfully returned from the `plan_path()` function and can transition to takeoff. 

- To carry out path planning, you'll define a new function within your `BackyardFlyer()` class, let's call it `plan_path()`. You'll need to run your `plan_path()` function at least once to determine the waypoints you need to follow from start to goal. Once is enough for a passing submission of this project. However, in real world planning situations, you may need to replan on the fly. So, if you're feeling ambitious you should consider adding a state transition for replanning.

- After your path planning algorithm returns the waypoint locations, assign them to `self.all_waypoints`. At this point, you are ready to execute the flight. Execute the flight the same way you did for the Backyard Flyer project, but instead of taking off and flying a square shape like before you'll take off from the start location, follow waypoints to the goal and land. 

## Step 7: Writing your planner

The tricky part of this project is determining your waypoints. In the lessons, you saw various ways to do this, from grids to graphs, and even the proabilistic roadmap. For your implementation, anything goes! Ok, almost anything... of  course, one easy plan would be to simply fly up until you're above all the buildings and then straight to the goal! That defeats the purpose here, so we'll impose a **max altitude of 3 meters** on your flight path to keep it interesting.  In the future we may put restrictions on how long your planner takes to find a plan or how long it takes to execute your plan, but for now it's all about simply finding a way to get from the start to the goal and executing your plan.  The minimum requirements for a passing submission are the following:

- Load the 2.5D map in the `colliders.csv` file describing the environment.
- Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
- Define the start and goal locations. You can determine your home location from `self._latitude` and `self._longitude`. Your submission will be tested against a goal location of (latitude = 37.408670 N, longitude = -121.999963 E), but feel free to play around with other goal locations. 
- Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm. 
- Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
- Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0]). 

You can write this code direction into your `plan_path()` function or in a separate file (recommended) and import it into your main script. The basic code for all these steps is provided in the lessons and you should feel free to pull from what is given there, but don't be afraid to get creative and explore even better solutions!

## Step 8: Write it up!
When you're finished, complete a detailed writeup of your solution and how you addressed each step. You can use the [`writeup_template.md`](./writeup_template.md) provided here or choose a different format, just be sure to describe clearly how you addressed each point in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view).
